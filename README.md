# web3-dev-intro

## Welcome to my Intro to Web3 Development! 
In this repo, i'll go through some of the first steps to getting started with developing for Web3, primarily using Solidity, to dev for the Ethereum netowrk.

## Installs
1. VS Code -> Our IDE.
2. NodeJS (npm) -> JS package manager.
3. Solidity Extension -> Allows Syntax highlighting in VS Code.
4. Remix Extension -> Bring features of Remix IDE to VS Code.
5. Solidity Compiler (Solcjs) -> Allows us to compile .sol files to EVM binaries.
6. Ganache -> Self-hosted Eth blockchain.
7. Truffle -> Testing and deployment tool.

### VSCode
* Follow instruction at [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), depending on your OS. Very simple install process.

### npm
* Simple 'brew install npm' in terminal assuming homebrew is installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

### Solidity VSCode Extention
* Navigate your way to the extensions tab on the left of VSCode home panel, and search 'Solidity'. Install top result.

### Remix Extension
* Navigate your way to the extensions tab on the left of VSCode home panel, and search 'Ethereum Remix'. Install top result.

### Solidity Compiler (solcjs)
* Using npm use the command 'npm i solc'

### Ganache
* Visit https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/ which should be able to detec OS. From here you can download .exe or .dmg file to install the GUI.

### Truffle
* I use the 'Truffle for VSCode' Extension from the Extension Market place. This allows newbies and experienced web3 developers to code, debug, and deploy their smart contracts without needing to leave VS Code.
