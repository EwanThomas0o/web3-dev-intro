# web3-dev-intro

## Welcome to my Intro to Web3 Development! 
In this repo, i'll go through some of the first steps to getting started with developing for Web3, primarily using Solidity, to dev for the Ethereum netowrk.

## Installs
1. VScode -> Our IDE.
2. NodeJS (npm) -> JS package manager.
3. Solidity Extension -> Allows Syntax highlighting in VSCode.
4. Remix Extension -> Bring features of Remix IDE to VSCode.
5. Solidity Compiler (Solcjs) -> Allows us to compile .sol files to EVM binaries.
6. Ganache -> Public testnets and self-hosted Eth blockchain.
7. Truffle -> Testing and deployment tool.

### VSCode
* Follow instruction at [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), depending on your OS. Very simple install process.

### npm
* Simple 'brew install npm' in terminal assuming homebrew is installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

### Solidity VSCode Extention
* Navigate your way to the extensions tab on the left of VSCode home panel, and search 'Solidity'. Install top result.

### Remix Extension
* Navigate your way to the extensions tab on the left of VSCode home panel, and search 'Ethereum Remix'. Install top result.

### Solidity Compiler (solcjs)
* Using npm use the command 'npm i solc'

### Ganache
