# web3-dev-intro

## Welcome to my Intro to Web3 Development! 
In this repo, i'll go through some of the first steps to getting started with developing for Web3, primarily using Solidity, to dev for the Ethereum netowrk.

## Installs
1. VScode -> Our IDE.
2. NodeJS (npm) -> JS package manager.
3. Solidity Extension -> Allows Syntax highlighting in VSCode.
4. Remix Extension -> Bring features of Remix IDE to VSCode.
5. Solidity Compiler (Solcjs) -> Allows us to compile .sol files to EVM binaries.
6. Ganache -> Public testnets and self-hosted Eth blockchain.
7. Truffle -> Testing and deployment tool.
